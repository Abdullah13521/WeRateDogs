# WeRateDogs
In this project I used python and its data analysis libraries to analyze the tweet data for the WeRateDogs twitter account. I gathered the tweets archive for the WeRateDogs twitter account using Twitter's API. I then used data wrangling techniques to assess and clean the data. I have found some interesting insights that I am going to share.
